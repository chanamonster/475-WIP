                Communication between housemates can often be difficult, especially when there are many responsibilities to keep track of. Currently, there are many web and/or mobile applications available; however, most of these applications only target money managing functions. This lack in expanded functionality prevents users from managing all their house-related tasks in one location.
                <br><br>
                Homies is a free web application that serves as a centralized hub to monitor chores and groceries, track bills, and chat amongst housemates. 
              </div>
              <div id="v-tab2" class="v-tab">
                <div id="tab-heading">Getting Started</div>
                <br>
                To get started, make sure all your housemates have accounts and are signed up for the same house. This way, everyone can be included!
                <br><br>
                <h3>Dashboard</h3>
                Get an overview of your chores for the week, how much money you owe or lent, and the current shopping list.
                <br><br>
                <h3>Chore Management</h3>
                See the chores assigned to you and others. Separated into categories for the current week, the coming week, and in the future, you can take a quick glance and know what chores need to be done!
                <br><br>
                When you assign a chore, you can make it occur once, repeat, or rotate and be assigned to everyone in the house. For your own chores, you can also set Google calendar reminders to make sure you get things done!
                <br><br>
                <h3>Bill Management</h3>
                The view is divided into five segments: balances (of everyone), what I owe, owed to me, (my) payment history, and others’ payments. You will be able to see details such as bill date, paid by/owed to, amount, and expense. 
                <br><br>
                Once you have completed a payment, you can simply click “Mark as Paid” and the bill will be redirected to the payment history tab. If someone has completed a payment to you, you may also mark their payment as paid and the bill will be redirected to the payment history tab. 
                <br><br>
                <h3>Grocery List</h3>

                <br><br>
                Once you have completed a payment, you can simply click “Mark as Paid” and the bill will be redirected to the payment history tab. If someone has completed a payment to you, you may also mark their payment as paid and the bill will be redirected to the payment history tab.

                <h3>Chat Messages</h3>
                Leave messages for your housemates to let them know what's up!

              <div id="v-tab3" class="v-tab">
                <div id="tab-heading">Frequently Asked Questions</div>
                <br>
                <h3>Can I split expenses between a select group of housemates? </h3>
                Yes. Simply go to the bill management page and add a bill. Uncheck any housemates you do not wish to charge for a bill.

                <h3>Is there a simpler method to add a bill after removing an item from my shopping list?</h3>
                Yes. After you mark an item as bought in your shopping list tab, it will appear in your purchased tab. Simply click the $ sign and you will be prompted to add a bill. 

               <h3> What is the difference between “mark as bought” and delete in groceries?</h3>
                Often times, users will have groceries that would like to repurchase on a regular basis. To prevent the hassle of creating a new grocery item every time, users can simply deactivate a grocery item once bought and reactivate it again when the demand comes. This is achieved through the “mark as bought” button. 

                <h3>Will this work on a mobile phone? </h3>
                Unfortunately, our small team can only currently support the app on a desktop interface.
